### how to mange down  

#### Giving Feedback - in a way that was helpful and direct, but also kind and thoughtful  

* **Ask first**  
  - so that the person can be mentally prepared for it ahead of time  
  - "Would you like to hear a suggestion?"  
  - "Do u mind if I give you feedback?"  

  - or start off by asking them "How do u think it went? what do u think was good, what could we improve"  
  - 

* **compliment + criticism + compliment**  
  -  "The work you ... good; " + "However, ..., it might be better"  

* be timely  
  - feedback is more effective when it is at the time of the event  
  - If too much time has elasped, use judgement  

* Make it about the task, not the person  
  - like **"Adding headers to the email would make it easier to read"**    

* **Give suggestions** on how to improve  
  - tell them how - **give them examples and ideas** on how to make something better  
  - more actionable 

* Provide a personal example  
  - easier to receive is to make the recipient feel like they are not the only one making the mistake  
  - **"I learned this the hard way"** or "**I used to do the same thing**"  

* provide people **the "why"** behind your suggestions  
  
* Allow the person to defend/vent/explain  
  - the receiving party may react by defending or justifying their approach  
  - if that, **just listen and allow them** to say their piece  
  - more ofthen than not they will still make the changes, but **knowing that you heard their side of things will make them feel better**    

* **把事情的前因后果说清楚**， 同时明确告知需要执行的事项

#### Learning to coach and delegate  
  - you are not just be the person who is the expert, you will be **someone who makes everyone better**   

#### The art of **delegating**    
* change your mindset 
  - have to focus on growth and education, not necessarily efficiency. 

* Adopt a leader:leader model instead of a leader:follower    
  - Being a good leaders means allowing the people around you to be the experts in their domains   
  - **transform my team to stop asking me questions**, and **instead make recommendations and ask for permission**  
  - **encourage your teammates to take more ownership** and lead their own arenas  
  - like "What do you think I would say"  

* Don't look for perfection  
  - open to the differences and you accept that other people may not do things the same way you would  
  - If worried about quality, define your quality up front when you assign the task 

* **Setup some guard rails**    
  - try to **identify what information you need to feel good** about the progress, and then **the best way to
  get the information** without being overbearing or micromanaging the details.  

    + like setup daily status meetings to go voer progress, bi-weekly code reviews to go over implementation, or weekly one-on-ones with other people on the project  

* **Help them come up with a plan**   
  - **have them draft up a plan** and bring it back to you   
  - **Go over their approach together, give them feedback** (like asking good questions)  
  - When **you can draft the idea together**, you will feel more confident in their approach and they will be able to **leverage your expertise and direction**    

* **Lead them to figure it out** 
  - lead them down your steps or your thought process on how you would solve the problem, not just give them the solution  
  - **"what have you tried so far?"**  
  - "What have you considered tyring" 
  - "What did you research? Did you find anything?" 
  - "And then finally, have you tried looking up ..."" (you would look for to find the anser)
  - 

* **start small**   
  - start with something that is easy to do 
  - find things that maybe aren't urgent but are small, iterative improvements that would be easy introduction into your realm of responsibility

#### tips  
* 如果对方善良  
  - 可以讲自己有不对的地方  
  - 指出对方的问题  

* 如果对方无赖  
  - 千万不要说自己有做的不对的地方  

### your manager   

#### treat your manager as a coach, not as a judge  

  - 主动向老板寻求反馈；主动问问上司，你的哪些工作令他们印象深刻，还有哪些方面需要改进
  -  定期要求与之会面，定期了解他对你的看法
  -  把重点放在应该完成哪些目标上， 更好地了解管理层对自己的期望，不仅涉及日常工作，还包括长期思维
  -  
  - 自己的事情主动跟进，有什么问题就跟老板说，讨论， 如果不是自己管辖范围内的事情，别人开心就好
这里最重要的是你对你提出的问题已经找到合适的解决方案。  


  - It is our job to do the hard and discern the impossible. it then becomes your job to help the entreprenuer find a reasonable solution which is merely hard and gets most of what they wanted. A solution is merely hard when it can be confidently scheduled and the risks are understood.
