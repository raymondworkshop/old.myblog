##### humors
*  because your consciousness can think and comapre with your memories. That's still you.
   thinking and being alive.

* i mean, maybe the imperfections make it more like life.  cause life isn't perfect.

*  > "I don't know. what color is the suit?"
   > "It would match with my eyes"

* "was that in the bath tub?"  "Because i did wonder"

* "幻觉黎啫, 吓我唔到"  (安慰)

* "烧鸡翼, 我钟意事"  

* 样衰都不是罪过哉  

* 抠女只有两个字 “靓仔”  
  那我就没问题了  

  靓仔不敢要, 有钱就好了  

*  


##### polite
* 辛苦你的这么早过来  

* "各位, 不好意思,来迟了; 根叔, 我头先见了台湾片商, 他送我靓茶, 我知道你钟意饮茶, 一定拿来孝敬你"

* You know, **I like the way you have** effieicently

* because **it's in a slightly different time zone than** the kitchen.
