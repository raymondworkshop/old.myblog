##### humors
*  because your consciousness can think and comapre with your memories. That's still you.
   thinking and being alive.

* i mean, maybe the imperfections make it more like life.  cause life isn't perfect.

*  > "I don't know. what color is the suit?"
   > "It would match with my eyes"

* "was that in the bath tub?"  "Because i did wonder"

* "幻觉黎啫, 吓我唔到"  (安慰)

* "烧鸡翼, 我钟意事"


##### polite
* 辛苦你的这么早过来

* You know, **I like the way you have** effieicently

* because **it's in a slightly different time zone than** the kitchen.
