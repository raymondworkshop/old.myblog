**You got all that from** saline solution?  (发了这么多想法... )  

**Even though** I **made him up** He must decide. (虚构)  

**No offense**, but that sounds nothing like her. 

"My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight"  

**I've seen her be a little** too into her looks. (我觉得她太注重外表了)  

**It's always been you**, Rach. (爱的一直是你)  

**You'd be a great person to** have around the day after an emergency.   (适合马后炮)
 
Hey, **Cut him some slack** (放他一马). It was Chandler's idea.  

**Let's get some perspective here**. **These things happen for a reason**.  (你们想下, 事出有因)  

Come on, You gotta give me another chance. (别这样,再给我一次机会)  





#### S02E07

It couldn't have been worse. A woman **literally** passed through me (简直把我当空气).   

You know what, **I go through the exact same thing**. (我也有过相同的经历)  

I would, but that might **get in the way of** my lying-around time. (妨碍)

Hey Phoebs, **how'd it go with Scott last night**?  

**If I seem a little nervous, I am**.  

Ok, Mike, **Let's talk about you**  

But because for the last hour and a half **I've been playing the movie Diner in my head**.  (回忆电影 Diner的情节)  
Look, I've been through a divorce. **Trust me, you're gonna be fine**.  

Laterly, I've **sort of had feelings for you**. (我对你有点感觉)  

**Let me get this straight**. (让我先搞清楚)  

I was doing great with Julie before **I found that about you**.   






#### S02E04  
Hold it. I **gotta side with** Chandler on this one. (我帮chandler说话)  

**You never know**. (天有不测风云)  

I don't know, **lately I get the feeling that** I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed. 

It's NewTon and he's **pissed**. (生气) 

What can I do for you? 

I didn't see it, but I want to believe you.  


#### S02E03  
I can **get a message to** her. (传话)  

You are **dead meat**. (麻烦大了)  

If **I'm going down**, I'm taking everybody with me. (拉个垫背的)  

Pressing my third nipple **opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of** Narnia.  (打开仙境之门)  

In some culture, Having a third nipple **is actually a sign of** (象征) virility.

You're **setting yourself up all over again** (重蹈覆辙)  .

ho, god, **I don't know how to tell you this**.  


In a nutshell, (简单说)  

You **put it off**. (延迟)  

I don't wanna **mess it up** (搞砸), you know?

**Catch me off guard** with (趁我没防备) a good kiss, and then **look far into my eyes** (凝视我眼睛), 

#### S02E02  
I couldn't **resist** (抗拒不了)  

**I'll be right back**. (马上回来)  

We're just **hanging out by** the spoons. (我们只是来看看汤勺)  

You have to **get used to it**. (习惯)

> actually, I sort of have plans.  
> maybe some other time.  
>  

>Rachel, do you have any muffins **left**?  
>Anyone else want one?  

>listen, you guys,  

**It's like** cheaing ....  (就像)  

And then **I realized that I'm against** that . (我发现我反对...)  

**I was just trying to be nice to** her ... 

And then **one thing led to another** ... (然后顺理成章)  

Of course, the **packaging** (容器) does **appeal to** **grownups** (成年人) and kids. 

It's no big dal (没什么)  

**Say** (假设) you do that, sooner or later, somebody will come along that .... 

**this isn't supposed to mean anything to me**. (对我来说毫无意义)  

I say you **stand your ground** (坚守阵地)  

I probably shouldn't even tell you this ...  

I really wanted you to like me, and **It's probably me just being totally paranoid** (也许是我胡思乱想)

That may just be a **pipe dream** (百日梦) .   

I'd say that chair's taking **the brunt of** (主要压力) it.
