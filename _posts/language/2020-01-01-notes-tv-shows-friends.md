Roger **wants to take her out** tomorrow night.  

We're some kind of magnets.  

Here's my credit card.  **Dinner's on me**.  (算我的)  

I have enjoyed the fact that ...  

**Anything else I should know?**  .. 
Nope. That's it.  

There's no way to tell you this ...  

Maybe I **screwed up** my first date in nine years.  (搞砸)  




#### S01E13  

You have no respect for anybody's privacy.    

Did I miss something?    

tit for tat (以牙还牙)    

I don't mean to be disrespectful ...   


#### S01E12  
I did this as a favor. I am not a caterer.  (我是帮你,我不是承包)

**What am I supposed to do?** (我该怎么办)  

I'm out of sorts (我心烦)  

Well, he made a move on me.  he made a pass at me. (他吃我豆腐)  


You **pick up the pieces**, and then you usher in the age of Ross (把握机遇, 走向ross 时代)

See, Rich, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether **is the answer**, I really don't.  
**I think that what you need is to** develop a more sophisticated screening process. (更成熟的辨别方法)

He's a lawyer who teaches sculpting on the side(兼职).  

#### S01E10  
So how'd it go?  (怎么样)    

It's all political. (潜规则)   It's just such a slap in the face. (当头一棒)  

I thought she had a hard quality. (没什么气质)  

**you are luminous with** a kind of a delicate grace.  (散发古典美)  

I had **such a blast with him the other night**. (那天晚上和他玩的愉快)

It was probably the first time I ever **mentally** undressed an elf. (产生扒光小精灵衣服的念头)  

It's tearing me apart. (我心如刀割)   I have no choice.  

I don't know how to tell you this ... 

**I'm no math whiz** ... **But I do believe** there are three girls and three guys right here .. 




#### S01E09  

**I was wondering do you think it would be possible if** I got ?   

Not that I believe any of this.  (并不表示我信这个)  

**I'd just like to say** that **I'm totally behind** (完全赞同) the experiment. 

we all chipped in. (凑钱)  

I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business. (我得说,你在那里最棒)  

Really?  You don't know what that means to me.  (我很感动)  

I guess what I'm trying to say is that ... 

#### S01E08  
how's it going? 

**how's she doing?** (她情况怎么样)  The doctor says **it's a matter of hours**. (只剩几个小时)

**It's a wonder** your mother **turned out to be the positive, life-affirming** (健康向上) person that she is.
