That's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.

Come on, would you just think about it?  ( 考虑一下)

> I wanted to be with you. I don't know, **I feel like lately you're slipping away from me. I know it's dumb**, but i just hate that I'm not a part of it.

> I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.  Honey, see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you because I do. But my work it's for me, you know?  **I'm out there on my own, and i'm doing it. And it's scary, but I love it because it's mine**. **is that okay?**



#### Succession
Don't ever do that to me again.
I have no idea waht you're talking about.

Ok, uh, and I'd prefer it if you didn't say anything..

I aim to please, madam (乐意效劳)

**No, he's not**.

So **what are you gonna do**? **How are you gonna tell** Chandler?

**That's what i was gonna ask**. thank you.

Anything you want to tell me?

**No offense** (没有恶意), but **I've always thought of** Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.

Janice, **I have something I need to tell you**. **And I want you to let me get through it**.  (讲完) because it's not gonna be easy.

I'll try to **hurry them along**.  (催快点)

> thank you for that information.

I like that you did that.
Of course, it does put you at a bit of a disadvantage now in terms of getting the job.

It's important to **represent who you are** at these things.

I don't need an unfair advantage.

The question is: what don't we do?

So **I wonder how they met**.

Just fascinating to me. what that initial spark is, you know?

So **then why don't you ask him**, why you would ask your, ur, customers?

Do u have any preference?

Any yet love is so universal.
We understand so little about animals, except that.

Can we just forget that that happened ?

I really had no expectation that this would happend tonight.

I'll make sure he does.

you'd stay if the roles were reversed.

For me, it's paralyzing. and so I have no bandwidth left for actual experience.
Does it make sense?

People are so **concerned to put on** (努力展示) this big front normally, but now you've seen me my most vulnerable.
