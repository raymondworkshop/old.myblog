<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The major minutia features of fingerprint ridges are ridge ending, bifurcation, short ridge or dot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A minutia, in the context of fingerprint descriptions, is a place where something unusual happens, such as two ridges merging or a ridge ending.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minutiae and patterns are very important in the analysis of fingerprints since no two fingers have been shown to be identical <a href="&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint" title=" &quot;Fingerprint">1</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>MCC representation associates a local structure to each minutia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fingerprints are normalized for size and orientation, so that if we took two images of the same finger.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A local structure associated to a given minutia is represented by a cylinder .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The local minutiae representation is based on 3D data structures (called Cylinders), built from invariant distances and angles in a neighbourhood of each minutia.</p>

<h5 id="locality-sensitive-hashing-lsh-3"><a href="&quot;http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html" title="   &quot;Mining of Massive Datasets">Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>LSH projects the data into a low-dim space; Similar items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability. Candidate pairs are those that hash to the same bucket.</li>
</ul>

<p>LSH drastically reduce the number of distances to be calculated by considering only those vectors that collide with the query vector under one or more of the hash functions.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Generalized LSH:  Amplify using AND-OR cascades

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LSH for Euclidean Distance
    A set of basis functions to start LSH for Euclidean distance can be obtained by choosing random lines and projecting points onto those lines <a href="&quot;http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html" title="   &quot;Mining of Massive Datasets">3</a>.  Each line is broken into fixed-length intervals, and the function answers “yes” to a pair of points that fall into the same interval.  Nearby points are always close and distant points are rarely in the same bucket.</p>

    E2LSH package provides a randomized solution for the high-dim near neighbour problem in the Euclidean space.</p>
