#### digging for requirements 
*  TODO 

#### workflow to Approach a ML problem -> Prototype 
* what kind of **question or goal** we wanna answer  

* how to **define and measure success** -> like using a business metric like increased profit or decreased losses  

* acquire the data and build a working prototype  - a loop [TODO] 
  - analyze the mistakes 
  - collect more or diff data 
  - change the task formulation slightly  

* humans in the loop 
  - algotithm might increase response time or reduce cost 
  - TODO 

#### From Prototype to Production 
* data analytics teams 
* production teams -> reimplement the solution for robust, scalable system 

  - offline evaluation 
  - online testing using A/B testing [TODO]


#### reference
