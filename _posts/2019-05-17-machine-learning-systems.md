#### workflow to Approach a ML problem -> Prototype 
* what kind of **question or goal** we wanna anser 

* how to **define and measure success** -> using a business metric like increased profit or decreased losses ? 

* acquire the data and build a working prototype [TODO] 
  - analyze the mistakes 
  - collect more or diff data 
  - change the task formulation slightly  

* how humans in the loop 
  - algotithm might increase response time or reduce cost  

#### From Prototype to Production 
* data analytics teams 
* production teams -> reimplement the solution for robust, scalable system 

  - test production system 
  - offline evaluation
  - online testing using A/B testing [TODO]
