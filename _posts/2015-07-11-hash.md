#### hashing
   * a set of N items
      - we can sort them with binary search in O(log N) time using a structure(i.e, an array) of O(N) space .  

      - while a hashing technique can consume O(N) space, and answers
      a dictionary query in O(1) expected time.  


    * hashing
      - the hash function h maps the university U of keys into the T[0...m-1]
      h : U -> T = {0, 1, ... m-1}

      - uniform hashing assumption: assume that any given element in U is equally likely to hash into
    any of the m slots, independently of where any other element has hashed to .
        For any diff integers k1 and k2, Pr(h(k1)=h(k2)) <= 1/m
      
    * Collision: two keys may hash to the same slot
      - collision resolution by chaining (link structure)
    
      - another one is open addressing 

#### hash functions
   * hashing by division h(k) = k mod m
      - map a key k into one of m slots 
    
      - if we know that the keys are random real numbers k
        independently and uniformly distributed in the range 0 <= k < 1
        then, the hash function: h(k) = floor(km) 

      - the division method can give good results, assumimg that a prime
      number k that is unrelated to any patterns in the distribution of keys . 
      
    * hashing by multiplication 
      
    * universal hashing 
      - TODO
