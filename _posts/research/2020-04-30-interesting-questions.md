### about beauty  
what's beauty?  why do people enjoy the beauty?  

### why do math models fit in with the natural world  
#### many real world phenomena can be modeled with analytic distributions, why?  

Analytic distributions are abstractions, which means **they leave out details that are considered irrelevant**.  

Analytic models are also **a form of data compression**. When a model fits a dataset well, a small set of parameters can summarize a large amount of data.   

Models are useful **if they capture the relevant aspects of the real world** and **leave out unneeded dtails**. But what is **"relevant" or "unneeded"** depends on **what you are planning to use the model for**.
