Unix standards originally developed to reconcile the APIs of the different branches of the family tree.   


In fact, on the the newer open-source Unixes (such as Linux) it is common for operating- system features to have been engineered using published standards as the specification.

During the Unix wars, technical standardization became something that cooperating technical people pushed for and most product managers accepted grudgingly or actively resisted.
