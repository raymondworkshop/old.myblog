abstract: "A share about Android NDK - build c/c++ code into shared lib app uses"

#### Android NDK  - build c/c++ code into shared lib app uses
  
  *  Android.mk - glue the c/c++ code to the Android NDK
  
     - defines properties specific to individual modules, or libs

  *  Application.mk  - defines properties for all the modules that app uses

  *  ndk-build -

  *  toolchain

  *  the dev tool is so important (eclipse is so terrible for this task)

#### about the linking [TO UPDATE]
  * Linking - concatenates blocks together, and decides on run-time locations for the concatenated blocks 
    - symbol resolution step - symbol table in .symtab associate each global symbol (functions and global variables) reference with a unique symbol definition

    - relocation - associate a memory location with each symbol definition, and then make them point to the memory location meger all sections of the same type into a new aggregate section relocate symbol references so that they point to the correct run-time addresses


  * linking with static libraries 
    - related functions can be compiled into separate object modules and then packaged in a single static library file; At link time, the linker will copy only the object modules(symbol resolution) that are referenced by the program.

  * advantages
need to maintain and update the static libraries periodically  
At run time, the code of the functions like I/O functions is duplicated in the text segment of each running process


  * dynamic linking with shared libraries 
   - a single copy of the .text section of a shared libray in memory can be shared by different running

  * the basic idea is to link the relocation and symbol table info when the executable file is created, and then complete the linking process (code and data ) dynamically when the program is loaded
