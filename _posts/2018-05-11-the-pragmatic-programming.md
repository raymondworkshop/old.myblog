#### The Pragmatic Approach 


#### The basic tools  - **tools** amplify your talent
    * Invest in your own basic toolbox
    
    * Plain Text is that standard
    Our base material is **knowledge**. We express that knowledge in our designs, implementations, test, and documents. The best format for storing knowledge persistently is **plain text**.
    
    * Power editing 
    Using one Editor could manipulate text as effortlessly as possible. we should know it very well, and use it for **all editing tasks**.  
      
    * Debugging - **fix the problem**, not the blame
     - debugging is **just problem solving**, and attack it as such
     - visualize the data -> get a good look at the data it is operating on
     - Tracing -> the state of a program or a data structure over time 
     - Don't assume it, **prove it**; and how to improve it 
     - master one text manipulation language
