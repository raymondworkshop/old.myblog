* being trusted
You must be trustworthy. You must also be visible. If no one knows about you, no trust will be invested in you.
you establish trust by being responsive and informative to those outside your department or team.
Don't pretend to know something that you don't.

* 交流
非正式交流值得任何事情去鼓励
Everything possible should be done to **encourage informal communication**. **More useful work is done during lunches with colleagues** than during any other time.

Disagreement is a great opportunity to make a good decision. **If you can support this decision even though you disagree, say so. This shows how valuable you are
because you are independent and are not a yes-man, but respectful of the decision and a team player**

A good mentor is a lot better than a book. At a minimum, **you should offer to study hard so their time won't be wasted**.

* work
It is our job to do the hard and discern the impossible. it then becomes **your job to help the entreprenuer find a reasonable solution which is merely hard and gets
most of what they wanted.**  **A solution is merely hard when it can be confidently scheduled and the risks are understood.**
