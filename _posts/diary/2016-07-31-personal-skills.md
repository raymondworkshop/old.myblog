#### being trusted
You must be trustworthy. You must also be visible. If no one knows about you, no trust will be invested in you.
you establish trust by being responsive and informative to those outside your department or team.
Don't pretend to know something that you don't.

#### 沟通能力
- 沟通之前先考虑清楚对方需要的是什么，绝对是对双方事半功倍的事情
- 说出“你的感受” （比如你这样说我，我很伤心），而不是 去为行为找理由
  * 讲”感受“的方式 （比如赞扬同事， 你那天给我一个表现的机会，我特别开心，觉得自己是团队的一部分）
   （比如： 希望对方 ）
- 打电话； 邮件约时间打电话； 不需要立刻回复／讨论的内容，发邮件   

#### 交流
- 用心听： 用心听对方的感受和目的, 别听情绪； 通过提问让对方说出来更多的有效信息

- 非正式交流值得任何事情去鼓励
Everything possible should be done to <font color="#800080">**encourage informal communication**</font>. **More useful work is done during lunches with colleagues** than during any other time.

Disagreement is a great opportunity to make a good decision. <font color="#800080">**If you can support this decision even though you disagree, say so</font>. This shows how valuable you are
because you are independent and are not a yes-man, but respectful of the decision and a team player**

- A good mentor is a lot better than a book. At a minimum, **<font color="#800080">you should offer to study hard so their time won't be wasted</font>**.

#### work
自己的事情主动跟进，有什么问题就跟老板说，讨论， 如果不是自己管辖范围内的事情，别人开心就好
这里最重要的是你对你提出的问题已经找到合适的解决方案。


It is our job to do the hard and discern the impossible. it then becomes **<font color="#800080">your job to help the entreprenuer find a reasonable solution which is merely hard and gets
most of what they wanted.</font>**  **<font color="#800080">A solution is merely hard when it can be confidently scheduled and the risks are understood.</font>**
