#### Similarity Search [1]
   * Similarity Search in high-dimensional spaces becomes increasingly important in databases, data mining, and search engines,particularly for content-based search of feature-rich data such as audio recordings, digital photos, digital videos and other sensor data. Since feature-rich data objects are typically represented as high-dimensional feature vectors.
   
   * The problem of similarity search refers to finding objects that have similar characteristics to the query object.  Similarity search is usually implemented as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) or Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) search in high-dim feature-vector space.
   
       +  KNN: find  the K objects that are closest to q according to a distance function
       +  ANN: find K objects whose distances are within a small factor (1 + x) of the true K-nearest neighbors's distances
   
   * An ideal indexing scheme for similarity search:
       +   Accurate: very close to those of the brute-force, linear-scan approach
       +   Time efficient: O(logN)
       +   Space efficient: the index data structure may even fit into main memory
       +   High-dimensional:  the indexing scheme should work well for datasets with very high intrinsic
       dimensionalities

#### The related approaches
   *  tree-based indexing methods for K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
       +  K-D tree: not time efficient for data with high-dim
    
       + TODO
        
   *  the indexing method: LSH  [1]
       +  use hash functions to **map similar objects into the same hash buckets with high probability** .
   
          using LSH functions to select candidate objects for a given query q,
          and ranking the candidate objects according to their distances to q.
    
       +  Drawback: to achieve high search accuracy, the LSH method needs to use multiple hash tables to produce a good candidate set.
     
          - Experimental studies show that the basic LSH needs hundreds hash tables to achieve good search accuracy for high-dimensional datasets.
    
          - The size of each hash table is proportional to the number of data objects, since each table has **as many
          entries as the number of data objects** in the dataset.
          When the space requirement for the hash tables exceeds the main memory size, looking up a hash bucket may require a disk I/O, causing substantial delay to the query process.
    
       + The approach does not satisfy the space-efficiency requirement.
    
   * Multi-probe LSH [1]
       + The main idea is to build on the basic LSH indexing method, but to use **a carefully derived probing
       sequence to look up multiple buckets** that have a high probability of containing the nearest neighbors of a query object.
    
       + Given the property of LSH, if an object is close to a query object q but not hashed to the same bucket as q, it is likely to be in **a buckets  that is "close by"** (i.e. the hash values of the two buckets only differ slightly).
    
       + By probing multiple buckets in each hash table, the method requires far fewer hash tables than previous LSH methods
