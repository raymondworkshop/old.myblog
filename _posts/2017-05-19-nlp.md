#### Human language
Human language is a symbolic system . Most words are just symbols for an extra-linguistic entity: the word is a signifier that maps to a signified (idea or thing).

The symbols of language can be encoded like voice, gesture, writing, etc via continuous signals to the brain.


#### Word vector representations: how we represent words as input to any of the models
