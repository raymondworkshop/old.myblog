#### Stack: FILO (first in, last out) [1]
   * Stored in computer RAM
   * stack grows and shrinks as functions push and pop local variables;
   Variables are allocated and freed automatically .
   
   * CPU manage the memory, reading from and writing to stack variables is very fast

#### Heap [1]
   * Stored in computer RAM
   * heap variables are essentially global in scope.
   * Heap memory is slightly slower to be read from and written to, 
   because one has to use pointers to access memory on the heap.
   
   * If we need variables like arrays and structs that can change size dynamically,
   then we will likely need to allocate them on the heap.
   
#### queue : FIFO

#### stack : FILO (first in, last out) 

#### Priority Queue
   * The case
     - We collect a set of items, then process the one with the largest key, **then perhaps collect more items**,
     then process the one with the current largest key.
     
     - a collection in which items can be added at any time, but the only item that can be removed is the one
   with the **highest priority**.
   
   * The implementations
     - unordered array/linked-list: 
	   + To insert: push in the stack. O(1)
	   + To remove the max: exchange the MAX with the item at the end, and then delete that one. o(n)
	   
	 - ordered array/linked-list:
	   + for insert to move larger entries on the right position,thus keeping the keys in the order array. o(n)
	   + The MAX is always at the end. O(1)
	   
	 -  **binary heap** [2]
	   + a binary tree is heap-ordered if the key in each node >= the keys in the node's two children [3].
       + To insert: **exchanging the node with its parent** to restore the heap condition
       + To remove:
            - take the key off the top;
            - put the item at the end of the heap to the top,
            - and then sink through the heap with the key to restore the heap condition
       
       + In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority item is always stored **at the root**, hence the name "heap".
       A heap is not a sorted structure and can be regarded as **partially ordered** . There is no particular
       relationship among ndoes on any given level, even among the siblings [4].


       + A heap is useful data structure when we need to **remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority**.
       
       + O(logN)
