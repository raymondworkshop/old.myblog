#### [to be more productive] [1]
  * listen to your body
    - Ease mental constraints - eat, sleep, exercise  
  Time when you're hungry or tired or twitchy is low-quality time.
  Improving it is simple: eat, sleep, and exercise.

  * hard problems
  break it down

#### 设计思维 [2]
  * 搞清自身需求（比如能给自己带来什么？） 进而定义真正的问题
