#### Notes on commu
  * 
  * team skills 

#### Notes on soft-skills 
  * **tell the hard from the impossible**  
    - **Find a solution** which is merely hard when it can be confidently **scheduled** and **the risks** are understood 
    - make the requirement more **clear** 
    - a clear definition of success -> often become merely hard 
    - 

  * fight schedule pressure -> **time-to-market pressure** <- reflect a financial reality 
    - **visible between the available labor and the product** 
    - 
    - maintain a concise and up-to-date **project plan** 
      + mark progress  
      + help make decisions 
    - 
    - how to estimate time 
      + restate your **assumptions**  
      + consider **prototyping the task** firstly 
      + prepare **a written estimate** by **decomposing** the task into progressively smaller subtasks (less than a day) 
      + **make this visible** to the manager  
      + try to have the people to estimate, and have **team-wide consensus on estimate**  
      + 

  * Understand the user 
    - figure out **what people really want** 
    - spend more time with users, **understand them**  
      + **propose** it to user 
      + **test your ideas** against them as much as you can 
      + 

  * Gather support for a project 
    - a prototype 
    - demo real value    


#### notes on technology 

#### notes on engineering 
  * **Problem Solving**  
    - Before you go rushing out to learn to code, figure out what your problem actually is. 
      + Do you even have a problem? 
      + Can you explain it to others in a way they can understand? 
      + Have you researched the problem, and its **possible solutions, deeply**? 
      + Does coding solve that problem? Are you sure? 


  * System thinking 
    - Think about systems and how they **interoperate**. Systems Thinking is more important than coding. 
    - Know what artifacts your system makes and what's needed for it to run. Know what kinds of things its good at and what it's bad at - in a non-zealous and non-egotistical way. 
    - Understanding the basic building blocks are important. 
    - 

  * Think about Abstractions 
    - learn how to think and when to dig deeper 
    - learn how to question how things work 
    - learn that everything new and simple **hides something large and complex** -> we are all standing on the shoulders of giants 


  * 总是想用不同的算法解决同一个数据问题，然后比较不同算法的效能 
    - 不同应用场景对于算法的新奇度要求不一样 
    - 在工业界，比起算法新奇度，**解决方案的 scalability 更重要**：能不能用到几个T的数据上，能不能当天内出结果，需要每天更新所有信息还是仅仅当天数据
