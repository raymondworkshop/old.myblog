#### notes on engineering 
 * **Problem Solving**  
   - Before you go rushing out to learn to code, figure out what your problem actually is. 
     + Do you even have a problem? 
     + Can you explain it to others in a way they can understand? 
     + Have you researched the problem, and its **possible solutions, deeply**? 
     + Does coding solve that problem? Are you sure? 

 * Think about Abstractions 
   - learn how to think and when to dig deeper 
   - learn how to question how things work 
   - learn that everything new and simple **hides something large and complex** -> we are all standing on the shoulders of giants 

 * System thinking 
   - Think about systems and how they **interoperate**. Systems Thinking is more important than coding. 
   - Know what artifacts your system makes and what's needed for it to run. Know what kinds of things its good at and what it's bad at - in a non-zealous and non-egotistical way. 
   - Understanding the basic building blocks are important. 

 * 总是想用不同的算法解决同一个数据问题，然后比较不同算法的效能 
  - 不同应用场景对于算法的新奇度要求不一样 
  - 在工业界，比起算法新奇度，**解决方案的 scalability 更重要**：能不能用到几个T的数据上，能不能当天内出结果，需要每天更新所有信息还是仅仅当天数据
