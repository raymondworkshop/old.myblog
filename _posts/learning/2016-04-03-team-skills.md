  “XXX, I know it might be a difficult day for you, and I really wanna do something for you if it helps. You have always been very very kind to me, like you are the first person to talk to me when I first came here. 

   I was always an introvert, and on top of that, I was raised to be very reserved. So maybe I appear to be not compassionate enough. But deep down inside, I am really grateful for what you did, and I am really eager to do something for you in return. Please do let me know if there is anything I can do for you. "
