#### Self  


#### **Manage your Manager**    
  * good managers **spend time thinking, coaching and growing their employees**    
    - Not all do this, or not have time, or they have a different set of strengths  

  * **learn to ask the right questions and get your manager to coach you**    
    - **prepared to your one on one meeting with a list of topics or questions** you would to cover  
    - it shows you take the time to prepare and appreciate the other person's time  
    - **by asking them for questions and feedback, they become invested in your success**    
      + this is a great way to build a bunch of successful, senior advocates in your organization  

  * **Understanding expectations**    
    - the biggest miscommunication occurs when **an employee misunderstands their role**, or **the expectations of that job**    
    - Asking some questions around your work, **the success of others in the same role, and expectations**, can **help you calibrate** and make sure that your energy is spent in the best way for the organization  
    -

    -  Whenever a project completes, **do a mini-postmortem with your manager on your contributions on the project**  
       + **Ask them for feedback and listen to the answer**    
       + regardless of what they say, it is valuable, listen and reflect it on it later  

    -  "What could I **do differently to better** at my job?"  
    -  "**What traits or experience do I need to develop to move up to** the next level?"    
    -  "This week/month/year **what have I done that was really great**? **From your viewpoint how could I apply that to future projects**?"  
    -  "What is something **I could have done better on project**"  
    -  "Is there any part of my job where **I am falling short**? **How do u think I could Improve**?"  


  * **Getting involved in leadership**  
    - Understanding ways to do this that **work well with your strengths** is important and can help you **bring your involvement and contributions to a much higher level**  
       + **learning how to mentor and help others** can be really valuable on any team (just make sure **this never comes at the cost of your normal work**)  
    - "**How can I support you (manager) better?  How about the team?**"

    - Also, **ask for their ideas** too, **working collaboratively together** will build your working relationship and hopefully solve your complaint

#### **peers**    
  * **Give up control**    
    - Not handling one aspect of your job **all by yourself**    
    - Being a good manager is all about **delegating**, even when working with other managers  
    - **Find ways to let other people help you**, and **let them know how much you appreciate their help**.
    - **Let them impress you with** what they can do  

  * Start **understanding your peers**      
    - foucs on **what this person really needs from you, and why**  
    - If you can understand your peers, you can **reach agreements with them faster**   
      + You'll know how to reach them and **what makes them take action or not**, so you both get what you want 
    - **build understaning**  
      + "what drives this person's perspective?"  
      + "What are their motivations and goals?"  
      + "What is their favored method of communication?"  
      + "What are their non-negotiables?"    

  * Think as "us" not "me"   
    - If you're doing your best work (and you know when you are) then having strong teammates who shine is a good thing  
    - you're pat of a organization, so the stronger everyone, **the better it is for all of you**    

    - Especially your peers would like to **help everyone**, not so selfish  
  
  * Recognize good work  
    - this will **build trust and consideration from your peers with simple recognition**    

    - **Praise someone** - sincerely, appropriately - when they've done something successfully.  
      + whether publicly noting all their hard work or just dropping by their desk to thank them for helping you  
  * Avoid being defensive  
    - **Ask questions and be receptive to feedback** when a peer criticizes your work or disagrees with you  
    - **Taking people's opinions seriously also builds trust** - and builds better managers too 

  * **Address grudges**    
    - Is a peer purposely making it harder for you to do your job?  
    - Instead of trying to stay out of their way, **make a point to get to know them** (and get them to know you too)  
    - It's harder to push someone out who's making an effort to get in  

  * **Have fun**    
    - **Do something not work-related** and engage with the pople on a **more personal level**  
      + **inviting everyone out to happy hour or meeting up on the weekend for a hike**      

  * **Focus on real relationships**, not political ones  
    - Remember that **someone** chats you up because **they wanna something from you**  
    - You need to **prioritize being authentic with them** - not self-promotional - **build a personal connection** even if a person does have the capacity to massively improve your career  
      + 
    - establish more meaningful initial contacts with your peers, then **nurture those relationships by coming back to them regularly**  
      +   

  * **Be active about sharing**    
    - prioritize "giving" instead just "take"  
    - **Build up trust and favor by being proactive about giving (support, ideas, whatever is needed)** before you need something back from someone  
    - The more you **practice thinking of ways you can be helpful to your peers**, the easier it will become  
    - This is especially helpful if many of your peers are also competitive towards you.  
      + Most people will **respond positively to your active efforts** to make their lives easier  

  * **See your peers as your most powerful advocates**  
    - It was **the people you befriended who were in the same position as you**   
      + You relied upon for opportunities, support, and big ideas  

    - engage them, and combine forces as you all get better at what you do  

  * Take the long view  
    - When you do your job, **think about yourself in terms of your role**, not yourslef  
      + what response is most helpful for my team, not me?  
    
    - **Make your primary focus doing the things that actually make good manager**    
      + building a strong team, doing work that moves the company forward, and creating relationships that a re beneficial for your team and your company

      - 我不希望看到一個為生活瑣事所累，毫無閱讀思考，成天為了眼前勾心計較的無趣之人

      - 所以自己最好能有点专长爱好，因为**某个特殊的爱好和技能结交一些志同道合，目标一致**，同时自己在那个方向领域中有一定的本事，别人和你沟通也能得到价值，你们沟通即是切磋交流思想同时排解孤独寂寞，同时互相在思想学识上收益，才是最好的思想上的友谊，这样的朋友，偶尔一起吃个饭喝点酒是很愉快的！

        + 年龄差距大的人 是不会成为朋友的  （尤其是刚毕业的年轻女性）  

      - 没有必要和所有人打成一片  
        + 要清楚不可能所有人都喜欢我，**人与人是要保持距离的**。有距离不是坏事，这是保持情感的方式。  
        + **不要怕失去朋友，不要猜测他们是否生气。要相信自己**。  

      - 在交友这件事情上，要**放平心态**。人以类聚，**一切随缘，不作强求**
