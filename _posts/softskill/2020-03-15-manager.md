#### treat your manager as a coach, not as a judge  



### how to mange down  
#### Learning to coach and delegate  
  - you are not just be the person who is the expert, you will be **someone who makes everyone better**   

#### The art of **delegating**    
* change your mindset 
  - have to focus on growth and education, not necessarily efficiency. 

* Adopt a leader:leader model instead of a leader:follower    
  - Being a good leaders means allowing the people around you to be the experts in their domains   
  - **transform my team to stop asking me questions**, and **instead make recommendations and ask for permission**  
  - **encourage your teammates to take more ownership** and lead their own arenas  
  - like "What do you think I would say"  

* Don't look for perfection  
  - open to the differences and you accept that other people may not do things the same way you would  
  - If worried about quality, define your quality up front when you assign the task 

* **Setup some guard rails**    
  - try to **identify what information you need to feel good** about the progress, and then **the best way to
  get the information** without being overbearing or micromanaging the details.  

    + like setup daily status meetings to go voer progress, bi-weekly code reviews to go over implementation, or weekly one-on-ones with other people on the project  

* **Help them come up with a plan**   
  - **have them draft up a plan** and bring it back to you   
  - **Go over their approach together, give them feedback** (like asking good questions)  
  - When **you can draft the idea together**, you will feel more confident in their approach and they will be able to **leverage your expertise and direction**    

* **Lead them to figure it out** 
  - lead them down your steps or your thought process on how you would solve the problem, not just give them the solution  
  - **"what have you tried so far?"**  
  - "What have you considered tyring" 
  - "What did you research? Did you find anything?" 
  - "And then finally, have you tried looking up ..."" (you would look for to find the anser)
  - 

* **start small**   
  - start with something that is easy to do 
  - find things that maybe aren't urgent but are small, iterative improvements that would be easy introduction into your realm of responsibility
