* think of rejection as a game and a part of life

* Establish yourself as someone worth knowing  
  - help someone who has **connected with me before** (sharing, or added value to me)  
  - seem **important**   

* demonstrate social proof  
  - get to know them is through **someone else** - ideally someone they know and trust  
  - **bring along someone** who has eatablished themselves as aperson worth knowing 
  - **Align yourself with people** you know are going to accomplish amazing things 

* find common ground  
  - begin with something **agreeable**  

* if you ask for something, let them know they have a choice  
  - remind your conversation partner that **they have the choice to say no**   

* don't give them too many choices  
  - just send them **2-3**    

* create positive associations - with yourself  
  - try to listen more than you speak  
    + "what is a book you read that left a big impression on you?"  
    + "when was your last vacation? where did you go and what didi you do?"
    + "what has been your greatest success or accomplishement this year?"  

  - if negative, express **real empathy and concern**, then turn to positive  

* Tell a story  
  - try **telling a tale that will appeal to their emotions**, not just logic  
  - be willing to **open up** and **share others** and people will feel more inclined to share and take part in your journey  


* **Be confident**  - **fake it until you make it**    
  - if you aren't comfortable do your best to **put on a happy face and fake it**  
  - **confidence will win over accuracy** when it comes to earning the trust of other people
