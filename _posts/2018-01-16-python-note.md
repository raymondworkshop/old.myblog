#### Python Data Model -> A Framework/API for core language constructs

Python interpreter invokes special methods to perform basic object operations.

By using and implementing special methods of Python Data Model in your objects, your objects can **behave like the built-in types**, enabling the expressive coding style **Pythonic**.

#### Data Sturctures
  * sequences
  Python sequences are often categorized as **mutalbe or immutable**, and also could be considered as **flat sequences and container sequences**. 
    - list -> mutable and mixed-type
    - array
  
  * mappings
  * sets
  * str versus bytes
  
#### Object Oriented


#### Functions as objects


#### Control flow  
  * Concurrency 


#### Metaprogramming 


#### reference
* Fluent python
