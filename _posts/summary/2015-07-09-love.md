        - make physical contact (shoulder touching, linking arms,) , holds strong eye contact, and smiles,
        - physical touch - hand on her back while you're waiting in line for tickets, hold hands during a movie,  perhaps giving a compliment or moving in close to face 

* Schedule more dates 
    + slow down and get to know each other naturally 
    +  keep things casual to begin - go out for food, see a movie, go for a walk or meet for coffee 1-2 times a week 
    + plan an activity she's passionate about it <- ask her
    + "Hey, I had a great time with you last night, thanks again for the awesome dinner.Let's get together again when you have some time"
 
* build trust 
    + giving turst for it, share a small secret, or goal  
    + as you become more comfortable, you'll likely trust someone 

* communicate your expectations for the relationship 
    + after going on 3-5 dates, you need to talk about where things are headed  
    + introduce her to your friends -> deeper 
    + then throw in some romantic surprise 
        - sent her flowers at work, or planned a fun weekend trip, cooked inner 

* 安全感
  - 冒险但不危险的气氛； 比如个人的反差性，比如 你本身会让人感觉到一些不安或难以琢磨，但相处下却发现你其实对她还不错
  - 引导力： 创造能带她参与的有趣环境， 有机会体验一下不同的人生，学习不同的新知，开拓眼界，甚至好玩
  - 环境造成的: **心跳加速**的暗示
  
  - 安全感是指：
    + 看你喜欢她的程度又多少  
    + 看你能不能反过来 克制她: 女人真正要的是一个不受她支配的男人 
    + 眼神中有自信，知道自己要的是什么； 对某些事情有原则，不因女生的在场而可以作修饰 
    + 一种发自内心的安全感，对自己很有安全感 
    + 学会不动声色地去关心对方 

* 自在阶段：
  - 在这个阶段累积你与女生的亲密感、信任度、记忆、安全感等要素。 若能藉此逐步加温，这段感情才会走得踏实
  - 调整力道的调情； 用力道强一些的调情手段试探。如果她正面回应，你就等于往前又站了一步； 可以多些互動  
  - 觀察； 做為一個男人，应该要积极些 

  - 让女方在你的引导下，对这段关系有所「投资」， 让对方有参与，让她感觉她在贡献某种价值 
  -  让女人觉得你有维护她、记得她的喜好即可 

* 追女人要让女生觉得你有趣、生命丰富、你有价值、跟你在一起好玩、开心、与放松(当然，你也要有同样的感觉才行 

* 建立信任感，最重要的就是： 让对方觉得，我们是了解他的；又两个大方向：
  - 说对方想听的话  
  - 让对方说想说的话
