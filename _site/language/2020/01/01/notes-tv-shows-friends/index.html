<p>everywhere I go today I <strong>keep getting signs telling me</strong> to go see my father.</p>

<p>I am so <strong>beat</strong> (累)</p>

<p>just wanna make sure <strong>we’re on the same page</strong> (达成共识)</p>

<p>How’d the interview go?</p>

<p>forget it. it’s probably <strong>stripped and sold for parts</strong> by now. (拆成零件**</p>

<p>we’re here for you .</p>

<p><strong>Only once in a blue moon does</strong> a dog’s ear grow back. (仅仅 … 狗耳朵才会再长出来)</p>

<p>Hey, pheebs, if you want, I’ll do it.</p>

<h4 id="s02e19">S02E19</h4>
<p>Glad to be of help.</p>

<p>Listen, um honey, I appreciates this. but you don’t have to keep hanging out with them for me.</p>

<p>oh, why does this bother me so much?</p>

<p>ok, what the hell happened back there? (刚刚怎么回事**</p>

<p>I really am sorry about, you know, before. <strong>i just want to make sure that i really do like you</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="s02e18">S02E18</h4>
<p>That was so lame. (好烂)</p>

<p>Oh, thank you Pheebs. <strong>That’s very sweet</strong>. <strong>Hear that?</strong> She likes me best, and <strong>apparently</strong> there’ve been a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Your name came up in a conversation</strong> that terrified me to my very soul.</p>

<p>You look good.</p>

<p>It’s gonna be ok.</p>

<h4 id="s02e17">S02E17</h4>
<p><strong>you know what they say</strong>: (俗语云)</p>

<p>look, I know you don’t want to hear this right now.</p>

<p>sweetie, listen before I forget, did I leave my diaphragm at your place?</p>

<p>Because you were <strong>mean</strong> to me … (刻薄)</p>

<h4 id="s02e16">S02E16</h4>
<p>Wow, this is <strong>wild</strong>! What are you gonna get? (很棒)</p>

<p>“That’s lucky. what if her name was …”</p>

<p>Rich is gonna be here <strong>any minute</strong>. (随时会到)</p>

<p>I tell you, I’ve never seen him <strong>this happy</strong>. (这么快乐)</p>

<p>very <strong>tasteful</strong>.</p>

<p>no-no, <strong>it’s not what you think</strong></p>

<h4 id="s02e15">S02E15</h4>
<p>“all right, but you better be wearing clothes when I open mye eyes”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So, uh, how was your day?”
“You know, pretty much the usual, sun shining, burds chirping”
“Really? Mine too”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You look great ( 你很美)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So how you been?”
“I’ve been great, just great. How have you been?”
“Obviously you know Barbara and I <strong>split up</strong> … “</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You two <strong>are totally into</strong> each other (互有好感).</p>

<p>“27 is a dangerous eye age.”</p>

<p><strong>It would really help when I’m kissing if you didn’t</strong> shout my sister’s name .</p>

<p><strong>what?</strong> (怎么了)</p>

<p>just put your hands out and i’ll <strong>back up into</strong> them (倒回)  .</p>

<p>“<strong>how’d it go?</strong>” (结果如何)</p>

<p>There’s no need to <strong>make it up</strong> (补偿). How?</p>

<h4 id="s02e14">S02E14</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>what’s this for?</strong>
well, I’m making money now, and <strong>this is paying you back for</strong> head shots,electric bills, and
so many slices of pizza I can’t even count
<strong>This is a little extra something for</strong> <strong>always being there for me</strong> (一直以来对我的关照).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know what to say .</p>

<p><strong>You are so wearing</strong> that bracelet. (绝配)</p>

<p>Once I’m used to the extra weight, I’ll be back on track.</p>

<p><strong>That’s your call</strong> (悉听尊便).</p>

<p>Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.</p>

<p>Man, that is <strong>sharp</strong> (犀利)</p>

<p><strong>“We were so sorry to hear about your parents”</strong> splitting up.</p>

<p><strong>“I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you”</strong>.</p>

<p>We were just <strong>doing some impressions</strong> (模仿) over here.</p>

<p>It’s just not worth it.</p>

<h4 id="s02e13">S02E13</h4>
<p>Don’t take it personal. He’s under a lot of pressure.</p>

<p><strong>We’ve got a problem.  She refuses to acknowledge</strong> her mustache.
<strong>Now unless someone convinces her to</strong> let me bleach it.</p>

<p>You <strong>look great job growing up</strong>.</p>

<p>Back then, I used humor as a defense mechanism.</p>

<p>“Execuse me, Hi. This is gonna sound kind of goofy, but my friend, she thinks you’re cute.”
“what should i tell her?”</p>

<p>What a jerk! (混蛋) I kept talking about you, and he kept asking me out.</p>

<p>It’s not a big deal. (不是大事)</p>

<p>Thanks for letting me <strong>tag along</strong> tonight, you guy. (带上我)</p>

<p>“That’s an exciting job. You must have a ton of cool responsibilities”</p>

<p>“So what are you guys gonna eat?”  (大家想吃什么)</p>

<p><strong>Because I went to an all-boys high school, and God is making up for it?</strong> (我上的男校, 现在god要补偿我)</p>

<h4 id="s02e09">S02E09</h4>

<p>Money is so <strong>impersonal</strong>, cookies says someone really cares.  (没人情味)</p>

<p><strong>I didn’t want to go wrong with her</strong>. (我不想跟着骗你)</p>

<p>Do you still mad with me? (不要生我气)</p>

<p>That’s right. <strong>I forgot about your ability to</strong> fuse metal.</p>

<p><strong>I didn’t get you anything</strong>. (我没有准备你的礼物)</p>

<p>That’s ok, <strong>you took a big step</strong> today. (踏出了一步)</p>

<p><strong>And last, but not least</strong> … (压轴)</p>

<p>He would stand and <strong>gaze up at her with adoring eyes</strong>.  (爱慕的眼神凝视)</p>

<p><strong>It was apple-blossom time</strong>, and the days were getting warmer.</p>

<p>Fern <strong>peered</strong> through the door. (to look carefully or with difficulty, 仔细看)</p>

<p>Wilbur <strong>tagged along</strong> at Fern’s heels.   (紧跟)</p>

<p>Fern <strong>broke down and wept</strong>. (忍不住哭)</p>

<h4 id="s02e08">S02E08</h4>

<p><strong>You got all that from</strong> saline solution?  (发了这么多想法… )</p>

<p><strong>Even though</strong> I <strong>made him up</strong> He must decide. (虚构)</p>

<p><strong>No offense</strong>, but that sounds nothing like her.</p>

<p>“My wallet’s too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight”</p>

<p><strong>I’ve seen her be a little</strong> too into her looks. (我觉得她太注重外表了)</p>

<p><strong>It’s always been you</strong>, Rach. (爱的一直是你)</p>

<p><strong>You’d be a great person to</strong> have around the day after an emergency.   (适合马后炮)</p>

<p>Hey, <strong>Cut him some slack</strong> (放他一马). It was Chandler’s idea.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s get some perspective here</strong>. <strong>These things happen for a reason</strong>.  (你们想下, 事出有因)</p>

<p>Come on, You gotta give me another chance. (别这样,再给我一次机会)</p>

<h4 id="s02e07">S02E07</h4>

<p>It couldn’t have been worse. A woman <strong>literally</strong> passed through me (简直把我当空气).</p>

<p>You know what, <strong>I go through the exact same thing</strong>. (我也有过相同的经历)</p>

<p>I would, but that might <strong>get in the way of</strong> my lying-around time. (妨碍)</p>

<p>Hey Phoebs, <strong>how’d it go with Scott last night</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>If I seem a little nervous, I am</strong>.</p>

<p>Ok, Mike, <strong>Let’s talk about you</strong></p>

<p>But because for the last hour and a half <strong>I’ve been playing the movie Diner in my head</strong>.  (回忆电影 Diner的情节)
Look, I’ve been through a divorce. <strong>Trust me, you’re gonna be fine</strong>.</p>

<p>Laterly, I’ve <strong>sort of had feelings for you</strong>. (我对你有点感觉)</p>

<p><strong>Let me get this straight</strong>. (让我先搞清楚)</p>

<p>I was doing great with Julie before <strong>I found that about you</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="s02e04">S02E04</h4>
<p>Hold it. I <strong>gotta side with</strong> Chandler on this one. (我帮chandler说话)</p>

<p><strong>You never know</strong>. (天有不测风云)</p>

<p>I don’t know, <strong>lately I get the feeling that</strong> I’m not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.</p>

<p>It’s NewTon and he’s <strong>pissed</strong>. (生气)</p>

<p>What can I do for you?</p>

<p>I didn’t see it, but I want to believe you.</p>

<h4 id="s02e03">S02E03</h4>
<p>I can <strong>get a message to</strong> her. (传话)</p>

<p>You are <strong>dead meat</strong>. (麻烦大了)</p>

<p>If <strong>I’m going down</strong>, I’m taking everybody with me. (拉个垫背的)</p>

<p>Pressing my third nipple <strong>opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of</strong> Narnia.  (打开仙境之门)</p>

<p>In some culture, Having a third nipple <strong>is actually a sign of</strong> (象征) virility.</p>

<p>You’re <strong>setting yourself up all over again</strong> (重蹈覆辙)  .</p>

<p>ho, god, <strong>I don’t know how to tell you this</strong>.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, (简单说)</p>

<p>You <strong>put it off</strong>. (延迟)</p>

<p>I don’t wanna <strong>mess it up</strong> (搞砸), you know?</p>

<p><strong>Catch me off guard</strong> with (趁我没防备) a good kiss, and then <strong>look far into my eyes</strong> (凝视我眼睛),</p>

<h4 id="s02e02">S02E02</h4>
<p>I couldn’t <strong>resist</strong> (抗拒不了)</p>

<p><strong>I’ll be right back</strong>. (马上回来)</p>

<p>We’re just <strong>hanging out by</strong> the spoons. (我们只是来看看汤勺)</p>

<p>You have to <strong>get used to it</strong>. (习惯)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I was just wondering if after work we could grab a cup of coffee</strong> …* ?
actually, I sort of have plans.
maybe some other time.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rachel, do you have any muffins <strong>left</strong>?
Anyone else want one?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>listen, you guys,</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>It’s like</strong> cheaing ….  (就像)</p>

<p>And then <strong>I realized that I’m against</strong> that . (我发现我反对…)</p>

<p><strong>I was just trying to be nice to</strong> her …</p>

<p>And then <strong>one thing led to another</strong> … (然后顺理成章)</p>

<p>Of course, the <strong>packaging</strong> (容器) does <strong>appeal to</strong> <strong>grownups</strong> (成年人) and kids.</p>

<p>It’s no big dal (没什么)</p>

<p><strong>Say</strong> (假设) you do that, sooner or later, somebody will come along that ….</p>

<p><strong>this isn’t supposed to mean anything to me</strong>. (对我来说毫无意义)</p>

<p>I say you <strong>stand your ground</strong> (坚守阵地)</p>

<p>I probably shouldn’t even tell you this …</p>

<p>I really wanted you to like me, and <strong>It’s probably me just being totally paranoid</strong> (也许是我胡思乱想)</p>

<h4 id="s02e01">S02E01</h4>
<p>She’s gonna <strong>go for it</strong> (争取) with Ross.</p>

<p>This is amazing, <strong>how did this happen?</strong></p>

<p><strong>We just wanted to say a quick hi</strong>. Then we’ll see the baby.
Then we’ve gonna get some sleep.</p>

<p>I like being surprised.</p>

<p>She looks at me and sees a friend. That’s all.</p>

<p>You own me one (你欠我), guy.</p>

<p>But the <strong>silver lining</strong> (好的一面), if you wanna see it is that …</p>

<p>I’m tring to <strong>spare</strong> your feeling (照顾你的感受) .</p>

<p><strong>That’s so sweet</strong> (你真好) . Okay, No, you hang up.</p>

<p><strong>I wanted you to have</strong> him too.
I know you did. (我知道你的心意)</p>

<p><strong>What’s going on</strong>? (怎么回事)</p>

<p>You got to tell Ross how you feel. (你必须告诉你的感受)</p>

<p>I think it’s <strong>10</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>You deserve to be with</strong> someone who appreciates you.
Someone who you feel good.</p>

<h4 id="s01e21">S01E21</h4>
<p>That may just be a <strong>pipe dream</strong> (百日梦) .</p>

<p>I’d say that chair’s taking <strong>the brunt of</strong> (主要压力) it.</p>

<p>Well, It’s <strong>technically</strong> (严格) not a zoo. It’s <strong>more of</strong> (更像是) an interactive wildlife experence.</p>

<p>They wanna know <strong>if you’re gonna be showing up for</strong> work (是否上班) .</p>

<p>If it wasn’t for you, <strong>I would never have gotten to</strong> sing …</p>

<p><strong>If you guys don’t mind, I’d like to take a moment</strong>, just me and him.  s</p>

<h4 id="s01e20">S01E20</h4>
<p>I don’t know. You don’t wanna <strong>mess with</strong> (惹恼) …</p>

<p>what’s going on? (怎么回事)</p>

<p>oh, I <strong>wasn’t expecting</strong> … (没想到)</p>

<p>Hey, I’ve been <strong>honing</strong> (一直在演练)</p>

<p>Maybe we could get together later?  (改天可以见个面)</p>

<h4 id="s01e19">S01E19</h4>
<p>I kind of wanted to <strong>run something by you</strong> (有些话想对你说)</p>

<p>No, <strong>you know what? It’s partially my fault</strong>.  I shouldn’t have …</p>

<p><strong>I’m sure</strong> there’s some friendly way to reconcile this. (调和)</p>

<p><strong>we do have certain expertise in</strong> the … (在 … 有专长)</p>

<p><strong>step aside</strong> (闪开)</p>

<p>Listen, I’m sorry <strong>I was so hard on you</strong> before (对你很凶) .</p>

<p>We still have that bottle of wine. <strong>Are you in the mood of</strong> something grape?</p>

<h4 id="s01e18">S01E18</h4>

<p><strong>I mean it</strong> (说真的). <strong>I’m sick of</strong> the tips (厌倦) .</p>

<p>That wasn’t an incident (不是故意的).</p>

<p><strong>Bad things happen to me anyway</strong>. (反正够倒霉了)</p>

<h4 id="s01e17">S01E17</h4>

<p>Well, <strong>only if you order stuff</strong>. (只有点东西才会贵)</p>

<p>Look, I don’t wanna do anything to <strong>screw it up with</strong> Ursual. (不想让ursual 不开心)</p>

<p>If you tried something like that, You’d <strong>be staing at</strong> (面对糟糕情况) the business end of a <strong>hissy fit</strong> (不可控制的生气)</p>

<p>Aren’t you a little cute to be a doctor? (当医生是否太帅了点)</p>

<p><strong>It’s like returning to the scene of</strong> the crime. (相当于回到犯罪现场)</p>

<p>I’m not <strong>freaking out</strong> (extremely emotional 不紧张)</p>

<p>“This is a great place. How long have you lived here?”</p>

<p>You just called <strong>a little while ago</strong> about needing …</p>

<p>OK, worst case scenario. <strong>Say</strong> (假設) you never feel like a father.</p>

<h4 id="s01e16">S01E16</h4>

<p>Not from where I was standing.  (从我角度看不会)</p>

<p>I’ll catch you in  gym (健身房见)</p>

<p>I’ll flip you for it. (掷硬币)</p>

<p>Once you’re inside, you don’t have to knock anymore.</p>

<p>He <strong>does not handle criticism very well</strong>. (不喜欢被批评)</p>

<h4 id="s01e15">S01E15</h4>
<p><strong>That’s the thing</strong> I don’t know … (问题就在于)</p>

<p>It’s great for me, caz you can make yummy noises.</p>

<p>Maybe this will <strong>cheer you up</strong>.  (让你开心)</p>

<p>I don’t mean to brag (不是自吹自擂)</p>

<p>I was always <strong>rooting for you</strong> (支持) two kids to get together (交往)</p>

<h4 id="s01e14">S01E14</h4>
<p>Roger <strong>wants to take her out</strong> tomorrow night.</p>

<p>We’re some kind of magnets.</p>

<p>Here’s my credit card.  <strong>Dinner’s on me</strong>.  (算我的)</p>

<p>I have enjoyed the fact that …</p>

<p><strong>Anything else I should know?</strong>  ..
Nope. That’s it.</p>

<p>There’s no way to tell you this …</p>

<p>Maybe I <strong>screwed up</strong> my first date in nine years.  (搞砸)</p>

<h4 id="s01e13">S01E13</h4>

<p>You have no respect for anybody’s privacy.</p>

<p>Did I miss something?</p>

<p>tit for tat (以牙还牙)</p>

<p>I don’t mean to be disrespectful …</p>

<h4 id="s01e12">S01E12</h4>
<p>I did this as a favor. I am not a caterer.  (我是帮你,我不是承包)</p>

<p><strong>What am I supposed to do?</strong> (我该怎么办)</p>

<p>I’m out of sorts (我心烦)</p>

<p>Well, he made a move on me.  he made a pass at me. (他吃我豆腐)</p>

<p>You <strong>pick up the pieces</strong>, and then you usher in the age of Ross (把握机遇, 走向ross 时代)</p>

<p>See, Rich, I don’t think that swearing off guys altogether <strong>is the answer</strong>, I really don’t.
<strong>I think that what you need is to</strong> develop a more sophisticated screening process. (更成熟的辨别方法)</p>

<h4 id="s01e11">S01E11</h4>
<p>He’s a lawyer who teaches sculpting on the side(兼职).</p>

<h4 id="s01e10">S01E10</h4>
<p>So how’d it go?  (怎么样)</p>

<p>It’s all political. (潜规则)   It’s just such a slap in the face. (当头一棒)</p>

<p>I thought she had a hard quality. (没什么气质)</p>

<p><strong>you are luminous with</strong> a kind of a delicate grace.  (散发古典美)</p>

<p>I had <strong>such a blast with him the other night</strong>. (那天晚上和他玩的愉快)</p>
