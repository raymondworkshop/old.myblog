##### [An Introduction about P2PSIP] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8JbPdkDj7JZQVpqbkwzeDM3bDQ/view?usp=sharing)
  * **Abstract**  
   Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) is a new technology currently being standardized in the P2PSIP working group of the IETF. A P2PSIP network consists of a collection of nodes organized in a peer-to-peer fashion for the purpose of enabling real-time communication using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In this report, an introduction of P2PSIP system and Distributed Hash tables (DHTs) algorithms are presented, which are used to organize the P2PSIP overlay.

##### [A Summary of online learning] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8JbPdkDj7JZZ3hTYXNlbDhSU1U/view?usp=sharing)
  * **Abstract**  
  Online learning has brought about dramatic changes in higher education, and a number of successful largeÂ­scale Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platforms such as edX, Coursera, and Udacity have been developed. This revolution raises a series of challenges and possibilities in technology and education fields. This summary presents an introduction about the latest progress in terms of online student behavior and skills, online assessment, course materials and online forums.

##### [An Instruction about incremental 3D reconstruction using Bayesian learning] (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8JbPdkDj7JZNjdXZE5GMVc4bGc)
  * **Abstract**  
   The essay mainly presents an algorithm for 3D reconstruction. The method first reconstructs an initial 3D model by selecting uniformly distributed key images using a view sphere. Then when a new image is added, its correlated reconstructed patches are searched and incrementally update the result model by optimizing the geometric and photometric terms. This can be applied for large-scale datasets or to real-time reconstruction.

##### [A privacy-preserving Similar Search] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8JbPdkDj7JZR2NQemVEQUNrZVU/view?usp=sharing)
  * **Abstract**  
  Refers to finding objects (i.e. face in biometric) that have similar characteristics to the query object
