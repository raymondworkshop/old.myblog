I'm Raymond ZHAO Wenlong, a Computer Scientist and Software Engineer based in Hong Kong NOW.

I like problem solving and reading.  Some of My projects are at [github](https://github.com/muyun) and my research is at [here](http://muyun.github.io/research/).  
Outside of science & tech, I like words, people, philosophy | math | nature | arts.   
<br> 

I graduated from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) with a M.S. in Computer Science and [Wuhan University](https://www.sciencemag.org/collections/celebrating-125-years-academic-excellence-wuhan-university-1893-2018?fbclid=IwAR0RzFSkpxaI8wk61JDnE7p6SWr7SlKXLyoFHkrg4-iqKGiRyE2gZfaGl8s) with a B.Eng in  Electronic & Information Engineering.
