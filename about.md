I like problem solving and reading. Some of my projects are at [github](https://github.com/muyun), and my research is at [here](http://muyun.github.io/research/).  
I worked as Technical officer at HSUHK, RA at CityU and HKBU, Software Engineer at Nokia Corporation (formerly Alcatel-Lucent), and a startup HKCREO.

Outside of science & tech & product, I mainly write on the world, people, culture, and self-improvement.
