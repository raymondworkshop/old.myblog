Interesting Personal Reminders from Arnold O. Beckman:
 - "Alwyas do your best; never do anything half-hearted (either get into it or get out of it)"
 - "Always strive for excellence - there is no substitute for it." 
 - "Never do anything for which you'll be ashamed later." 
 - "Maintain integrity."
