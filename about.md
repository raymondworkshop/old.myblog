Hi, I'm Raymond. I'm a Computer Scientist and Software Engineer based in Hong Kong NOW.   
<br>  

You can see some of my projects on [github](https://github.com/muyun), find my slides & research at [here](http://muyun.github.io/research/), or just send me an [email](mailto:wenlzhao@gmail.com).  
<br>  

I like problem solving and reading. I worked as Technical Officer at HSUHK, RA at CityU and HKBU, Software Engineer at HKCREO (a Fintech startup) and Alcatel-Lucent S.A. (Nokia Corporation now) .   
<br>    


Outside of Engineering & Philosophy world, I also like personal growth, product & service, language, and art NOW.  
<br>   

I am an active learner. I have a BS in Electroic and Information Engineering from [Wuhan University](https://www.sciencemag.org/collections/celebrating-125-years-academic-excellence-wuhan-university-1893-2018?fbclid=IwAR0RzFSkpxaI8wk61JDnE7p6SWr7SlKXLyoFHkrg4-iqKGiRyE2gZfaGl8s), and a MS in Computer Science from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). I also hold a Diploma in International Business Communication from HKU.   
<br>  

I believe that "The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge".  
All opinions here are my own.
