My name is Raymond ZHAO Wenlong, a Computer Scientist and Software Engineer based in Hong Kong NOW.

<br>


I like problem solving and reading. Some of my projects are at [github](https://github.com/muyun), and my research is at [here](http://muyun.github.io/research/).  

Outside of science & tech, I mainly write on the world, culture, and self-improvement with ‘growth mindset’.  
<br> 

I worked as technical officer at HSUHK, RA at CityU and HKBU, and software engineer at Nokia Corporation (formerly Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell Co Ltd), and HKCREO(startup).    
<br> 

I has a BS in Electroic and Information Engineering from [Wuhan University](https://www.sciencemag.org/collections/celebrating-125-years-academic-excellence-wuhan-university-1893-2018?fbclid=IwAR0RzFSkpxaI8wk61JDnE7p6SWr7SlKXLyoFHkrg4-iqKGiRyE2gZfaGl8s), and a MS in Computer Science from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). I also hold a diploma in Advanced General English from HKU Space.   
<br>  
 
Sometimes I do some [readings](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/8677506?shelf=%23ALL%23), and see some [movies&documentaries](https://movie.douban.com/people/aiding2001/collect).        
I believe that "The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge".   
All opinions here are my own.
