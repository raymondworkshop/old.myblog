I like problem solving and reading. Some of My projects are at [github](https://github.com/muyun) and my research are [here](http://muyun.github.io/research/).  In my free time, I'd like to explore something new, especially like people, philosophy, words, nature and arts. All opinions here are my own.

I graduated from [Wuhan University](https://www.sciencemag.org/collections/celebrating-125-years-academic-excellence-wuhan-university-1893-2018?fbclid=IwAR0RzFSkpxaI8wk61JDnE7p6SWr7SlKXLyoFHkrg4-iqKGiRyE2gZfaGl8s) and [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html).
