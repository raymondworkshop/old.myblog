          <li><strong>The stronger</strong> your BATNA, the more leverage you have in the negotiation</li>
          <li>
            <p>the BATNA tell you when to talk, not when to sign</p>
          </li>
          <li>You always have a BATNA</li>
          <li><strong>Always improve</strong> your BATNA</li>
          <li><strong>Never reveal your BATNA to the counter-party</strong>

      <li>â€œXXX, I know it might be a difficult day for you, and I really wanna do something for you if it helps. You have always been very very kind to me, like you are the first person to talk to me when I first came here.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I was always an introvert, and on top of that, I was raised to be very reserved. So maybe I appear to be not compassionate enough. But deep down inside, I am really grateful for what you did, and I am really eager to do something for you in return. Please do let me know if there is anything I can do for you. â€œ</p>
