<p>I like problem solving and reading. Some of my projects are at <a href="https://github.com/muyun">github</a>, and my research is at <a href="http://muyun.github.io/research/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of science &amp; tech, I mainly write on the world, people, culture, and self-improvement with ‘growth mindset’.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>I worked as technical officer at HSUHK, RA at CityU and HKBU, and software engineer at Nokia Shanghai Bell Co Ltd (formerly Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell Co Ltd), and HKCREO(startup).  <br />
<br /></p>

<p>I has a BS in Electroic and Information Engineering from <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/collections/celebrating-125-years-academic-excellence-wuhan-university-1893-2018?fbclid=IwAR0RzFSkpxaI8wk61JDnE7p6SWr7SlKXLyoFHkrg4-iqKGiRyE2gZfaGl8s">Wuhan University</a>, and a MS in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>. I also hold a diploma in Advanced General English from HKU Space. <br />
<br /></p>

<p>Sometimes I read some <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/8677506?shelf=%23ALL%23">books</a>, and see some <a href="https://movie.douban.com/people/aiding2001/collect">movies</a> in my spare time.     <br />
I believe that “The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge”. <br />
All opinions here are my own.  <br />
